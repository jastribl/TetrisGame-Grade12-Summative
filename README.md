# TetrisGame-Grade12-Summative
Summative programming project for grade 12 Computer Science / Programming course.

 - Planned, coded, and rigorously tested my own Tetris like game
 - Gained valuable experience with animation (double buffering), game design, and Object Oriented Programming (class abstraction and implantation)
 - Project created, debugged and tested in a short amount of time
- Debugging and testing included coding errors and rigorous case-based-testing for specific physical and logical events (how shapes interact with each other when rotated)
 - Implemented many design and code aspects outside of the scope of the course including the Graphics class and high quality small-scale game development
 - Earned a final project and course grade of 100% by far surpassing the expected standards and going the extra mile
